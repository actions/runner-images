## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your changes, ensure that they include steps to install and validate post-install (e.g. [kind.sh](images/linux/scripts/installers/kind.sh)).

      Adding tool for Windows images:
    - add tool installation script `Install-ToolName.ps1` (`/images/win/scripts/Installers`)
    - add tool validation script `Validate-ToolName.ps1` (the same directory)
    - add changes to document tool name and version to the software report generator: `images/win/scripts/SoftwareReport/SoftwareReport.Generator.ps1` that is used to generate software README file, e.g. [Windows2019-Readme.md](images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md)

1. Test your changes by [creating VHD and deploying a VM](help/CreateImageAndAzureResources.md).
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the style guide for [Powershell](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle) when writing Windows scripts. There is currently no set style for the Shell scripts that run Linux installs :soon:.
- Include complete details of why this is needed in the PR description. If it's a new piece tool being installed, consider cross-platform. If the tool is available in other platforms (MacOS, Windows, Linux), make sure you include it in as many as possible.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
