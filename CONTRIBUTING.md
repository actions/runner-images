Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [MIT](LICENSE.md).

## Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
1. Make your changes, ensure that they include steps to install, validate post-install and update software report (please see [How to add new tool](CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-add-new-tool) for details).
1. Test your changes by [creating image and deploying a VM](docs/create-image-and-azure-resources.md).
1. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow the style guide for [Powershell](https://github.com/PoshCode/PowerShellPracticeAndStyle) when writing Windows scripts. There is currently no set style for the Shell scripts that run Linux installs :soon:.
- Include complete details of why this is needed in the PR description.
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- For new tools:
  - Make sure that the tool satisfies [Software Guidelines](README.md#software-guidelines).
  - Create an issue and get an approval from us to add this tool to the image before creating the pull request.

## How to add new tool

### General rules

- For every new tool add validation scripts and update software report script to make sure that it is included to documentation
- If the tool is available in other platforms (macOS, Windows, Linux), make sure you include it in as many as possible.
- If installing a few versions of the tool, consider putting the list of versions in the corresponding `toolset.json` file. It will help other customers to configure their builds flexibly. See [toolset-windows-2019.json](images/win/toolsets/toolset-2019.json) as example.
- Use consistent naming across all files
- Validation scripts should be simple and shouldn't change image content

### Windows

- Add a script that will install the tool and put the script in the `scripts/Installers` folder.  
There are a bunch of helper functions that could simplify your code: `Choco-Install`, `Install-Binary`, `Install-VsixExtension`, `Start-DownloadWithRetry`, `Test-IsWin19`, `Test-IsWin22` (find the full list of helpers in [ImageHelpers.psm1](images/win/scripts/ImageHelpers/ImageHelpers.psm1)).
- Add a script that will validate the tool installation and put the script in the `scripts/Tests` folder.  
We use [Pester v5](https://github.com/pester/pester) for validation scripts. If the tests for the tool are complex enough, create a separate `*.Tests.ps1`. Otherwise, use `Tools.Tests.ps1` for simple tests.  
Add `Invoke-PesterTests -TestFile <testFileName> [-TestName <describeName>]` at the end of the installation script to make sure that your tests will be run.
- Add changes to the software report generator `images/win/scripts/SoftwareReport/SoftwareReport.Generator.ps1`. The software report generator is used to generate an image's README file, e.g. [Windows2019-Readme.md](images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md) and uses [MarkdownPS](https://github.com/Sarafian/MarkdownPS).

### Ubuntu

- Add script that will install and validate the tool and put the script in the `scripts/installers` folder.
Use existing scripts such as [github-cli.sh](images/linux/scripts/installers/github-cli.sh) as a starting point.
  - Use [helpers](images/linux/scripts/helpers/install.sh) to simplify installation process.
  - Validation part should `exit 1` if any issue with installation.
- Add changes to the software report generator `images/linux/scripts/SoftwareReport/SoftwareReport.Generator.ps1`. The software report generator is used to generate an image's README file, e.g. [Ubuntu2004-Readme.md](images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md) and it uses [MarkdownPS](https://github.com/Sarafian/MarkdownPS).

### macOS

macOS source lives in this repository and available for everyone. However, macOS image-generation CI doesn't support external contributions yet so we are not able to accept pull-requests for now.
We are in the process of preparing macOS CI to accept contributions. Until then, we appreciate your patience and ask you continue to make tool requests by filing issues.
