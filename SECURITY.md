If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues
Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report.

Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
