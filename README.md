This repository demonstrates how to set up and configure a self-hosted Azure DevOps agent using prebuilt images. The guide provides a comprehensive overview of the steps needed to deploy and manage your own agent to optimize CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

Azure DevOps allows users to configure self-hosted agents for build and release pipelines. By using prebuilt images, we can simplify the agent setup process and increase efficiency. This approach minimizes the configuration overhead and provides a faster setup for development teams.

For detailed information about using prebuilt images in your self-hosted agent, refer to the [full guide here](https://azureway.cloud/azure-devops-self-hosted-agent-using-prebuilt-images/).

## Features

- Prebuilt agent images to reduce setup complexity
- Customizable pipeline configurations for specific use cases
- Full control over your build and deployment environments
- Cost-effective alternative to Microsoft-hosted agents
